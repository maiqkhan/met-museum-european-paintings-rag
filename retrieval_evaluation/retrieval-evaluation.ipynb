    "        - Example: \"painting with water lilies and Japanese bridge\"\n",

    "\n",
    "        2. THEMATIC QUERIES (25%): Broader themes that should include this painting\n",
    "        - Focus on subject matter, symbolism, or narrative that are present in the painting's description\n",
    "        - Example: \"paintings depicting mythology from ancient Greece\"\n",
    "        - Difficulty: Medium\n",
    "\n",
    "        3. COMPARATIVE QUERIES (20%): Reference similar works, movements, or styles\n",
    "        - Require understanding of art history context\n",
    "        - Example: \"works similar to Caravaggio's dramatic lighting style\"\n",

    "        B. LINGUISTIC DIVERSITY:\n",
    "        - Vary formality: questions vs. statements vs. keywords\n",

    "        - Different query lengths: 5-25 words\n",

    "        C. EDGE CASES TO INCLUDE (at least 2):\n",
    "        - Misspellings or informal terms\n",
