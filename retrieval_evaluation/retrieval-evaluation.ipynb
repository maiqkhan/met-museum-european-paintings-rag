The description of the artwork is: 'Courbet painted this view looking out over the English Channel during a visit to Étretat along the coast of Normandy in August 1869. The ocean has receded at low tide, and two small boats are left on the shore. The tranquil composition, with its immense sky towering over narrow bands of water and sand, is unusual for Courbet’s marine paintings of this period, dominated by dramatically crashing waves.'.

The description of the artwork is: 'Morales mined a similar vein of visionary spirituality to El Greco, but often with a morbid sensibility characteristic of the most dramatic Spanish devotional imagery. Life drains from Christ’s body, which collapses from his mother’s arms, as the viewer joins the intimate moment of his death. Unlike El Greco’s rough paint handling, Morales perfected an impossibly soft, smooth surface that contrasts with the figures’ high emotional pitch. An almost obsessive interest in details (eyelashes, teardrops, rivulets of blood) follows Netherlandish painting traditions and lends a realism to this otherworldly vision.'.

The description of the artwork is: 'The canvas illustrates a passage from Ludovico Ariosto's (1474–1533) epic poemOrlando Furioso(XIX:36), in which the two lovers engrave their names in the bark of a tree. Because the painting's surface is worn, the letters are no longer visible. In the early 1630s Blanchard decorated the galleries of private houses in Paris with series of narrative painting such as this. The soft lighting and languid nudity suggest the influence of sixteenth-century Venetian painting.'. The source/origin of the artwork is Gift of George A.
